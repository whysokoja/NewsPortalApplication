<![CDATA[ <p>&nbsp;</p><p>Barcelona director Mateu Alemany has, on Sunday night, provided an insight into not only the club&rsquo;s ongoing contract negotiations with key pair Ronald Araujo and Ousmane Dembele, but also their alleged pursuit of Chelsea star Antonio Rudiger.</p><p>First up came the latest on Dembele&rsquo;s situation.</p><p>The name of wide-man Dembele has of course come back to the fore in a major way in the Catalan capital of late, owing to a head-turning return to not only fitness, but also form on the part of the Frenchman.</p><p>In turn, murmurs have begun to spread that the board at the Camp Nou could be tempted to give in to their explosive winger&rsquo;s exorbitant wage demands, to seal an agreement ahead of the expiration of his contract in the summer.</p><p>The aforementioned Alemany, however, was quick to assure this evening that this will not prove the case, explaining:</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"> <p dir="ltr" lang="en">Barcelona director Alemany on Demb&eacute;l&eacute;&rsquo;s contract: &ldquo;Everyone knows the financial situation of the club, whoever wants to stay will have to agree to the club&rsquo;s salary limits, whether it&rsquo;s Demb&eacute;l&eacute; or other players who want to come&rdquo;. <a href="https://twitter.com/barcacentre?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@barcacentre</a> &#128308; <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/FCB?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#FCB</a></p> <p>&mdash; Fabrizio Romano (@FabrizioRomano) <a href="https://twitter.com/FabrizioRomano/status/1510708234864181249?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 3, 2022</a></p></blockquote><p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p><p>Turning attentions towards the centre-back department in Catalunya, the Barca chief was also drawn on the club&rsquo;s rumoured pursuit of Chelsea defender Antonio Rudiger, and whether the German&rsquo;s arrival in the summer could impact contract talks with the highly-regarded Ronald Araujo.</p><p>Alemany, though, shut down any such suggestions, albeit whilst, in the process, simultaneously confirming the Blaugrana&rsquo;s interest in Rudiger:</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"> <p dir="ltr" lang="en">Barcelona director Alemany on R&uuml;diger talks and Ara&uacute;jo: &ldquo;R&uuml;diger thing does not affect Ara&uacute;jo&rsquo;s future at all.

Had very little to do after that.</p><p>Cristiano Romero (8) &ndash; A dominant presence at the back, played a key role in keeping Allan Saint-Maximin quiet and was also crucial to starting Spurs&rsquo; attacks by bringing the ball out from deep.</p><p>Eric Dier (6.5) &ndash; A solid if unspectacular outing from Dier.</p><p>Ben Davies (6.5) &ndash; Another solid showing at centre-back for the Welshman, bringing the ball out from the back confidently and also getting himself on the scoresheet.</p><p>Emerson Royal (7) &ndash; Did little wrong defensively on the day and scored Tottenham&rsquo;s 4<sup>th</sup>.</p><p>Rodrigo Bentancur (7.5) &ndash; Worked well in his box-to-box role, helping out at both ends of the pitch, including opening up Newcastle&rsquo;s defence a few times with some clever passing.</p><p>Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg (7) &ndash; Passing and movement off the ball were crucial to Tottenham dominating play in the first half.</p><p>Matt Doherty (8) &ndash; Had a very quiet first 45, struggling out of position on the left flank, but he would get a goal early in the second before also setting up Emerson later in the game.</p><p>Dejan Kulusevski (7.5) &ndash; Showed great pace and crossing ability to set up Tottenham&rsquo;s third.</p><p>Heung-min Son (7.5) &ndash; Gave away the free-kick which led to Schar&rsquo;s goal, but would atone for his error by setting up Davies&rsquo; equaliser and then scoring Tottenham&rsquo;s third of the day.</p><p>Harry Kane (7.5) &ndash; Very underwhelming first half, but produced a brilliant cross moments into the second for Doherty&rsquo;s goal. Continued to be the focal point of all of Spurs&rsquo; attacks from then on.</p><p><strong>Substitutes </strong></p><p>Lucas Moura (6.5) &ndash; Set up Bergwijn for Tottenham&rsquo;s 5th.</p><p>Harry Winks &nbsp;(5) &ndash; Did not do anything wrong in the short period he was on the pitch for.</p><p>Steven Bergwijn (7) &ndash; Added Spurs&rsquo; 5<sup>th</sup> late on.</p><h2>Newcastle player ratings</h2><p>Martin Dubravka (4) &ndash; Did not do anything egregiously wrong but still conceded five goals.</p><p>Javier Manquillo (4) &ndash; Kept Son quiet for much of the first half but his tracking of Doherty for Spurs&rsquo; second was poor. Taken off after 59 minutes.</p><p>Fabian Schar (5.5) &ndash; Scored the opening goal and helped keep Kane&rsquo;s threat to a minimum in the first half, but was overrun in the second 45.</p><p>Dan Burn (4) &ndash; Didn&rsquo;t make any major errors but being part of a defence that concedes five goals is not a good look for any centre-back.</p><p>Matt Targett (3.5) &ndash; Poor marking of Ben Davies for the Tottenham man&rsquo;s goal and was outpaced by Kulusevski in the build-up to Son&rsquo;s strike.</p><p>Joe Willock (3) &ndash; Like his midfield partners, Willock struggled to have any impact on the game at either end of the pitch.</p><p>Jonjo Shelvey (3) &ndash; Defensively lacking on the day and didn&rsquo;t offer much going forward either.</p><p>Joelinton (3) &ndash; Poor marking for the Ben Davies equaliser and could have closed Kane down quicker in the build-up to Tottenham&rsquo;s second. Off after 58 minutes.</p><p>Ryan Fraser (3.5) &ndash; A very uninspiring outing that saw his threat neutralised by Doherty and Davies.</p><p>Allan Saint-Maximin (3.5) &ndash; Not the Frenchman&rsquo;s best display, as he really struggled to deal with Cristian Romero, who was superb.</p><p>Chris Wood (3) &ndash; Was isolated up front on his own for much of the game and taken off with 20 minutes left.</p><p><strong>Substitutes </strong></p><p>Bruno Guimaraes (3.5) &ndash; Brought on to try to provide Newcastle with some much-needed control in midfield, which he did not do.</p><p>Jacob Murphy (2) &ndash; Should have closed Doherty down to better effect in the build-up to Emerson&rsquo;s goal.</p><p>Jamaal Lascelles (2) &ndash; Brought on with the match at 4-1 and Eddie Howe looking to prevent the scoreline from getting any more embarrassing, but Spurs nevertheless added another after his introduction.</p><p><a href="https://www.101greatgoals.com/premier-league-betting-tips/">Click here to view our latest Premier League betting tips.</a></p><h2>The Premier League table as it stands</h2><p> <div class="overflow-x"> <table class="gg101__table"> <thead> <tr> <th>#</th> <th>Team</th> <th>MP</th> <th>W</th> <th>D</th> <th>L</th> <th>F</th> <th>A</th> <th>D</th> <th>P</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>1</td> <td>Manchester City</td> <td>30</td> <td>23</td> <td>4</td> <td>3</td> <td>70</td> <td>18</td> <td>52</td> <td>73</td> </tr> <tr> <td>2</td> <td>Liverpool FC</td> <td>30</td> <td>22</td> <td>6</td> <td>2</td> <td>77</td> <td>20</td> <td>57</td> <td>72</td> </tr> <tr> <td>3</td> <td>Chelsea FC</td> <td>29</td> <td>17</td> <td>8</td> <td>4</td> <td>58</td> <td>23</td> <td>35</td> <td>59</td> </tr> <tr> <td>4</td> <td>Arsenal FC</td> <td>28</td> <td>17</td> <td>3</td> <td>8</td> <td>44</td> <td>31</td> <td>13</td> <td>54</td> </tr> <tr> <td>5</td> <td>Tottenham Hotspur</td> <td>29</td> <td>16</td> <td>3</td> <td>10</td> <td>47</td> <td>36</td> <td>11</td> <td>51</td> </tr> <tr> <td>6</td> <td>Manchester United</td> <td>30</td> <td>14</td> <td>9</td> <td>7</td> <td>49</td> <td>41</td> <td>8</td> <td>51</td> </tr> <tr> <td>7</td> <td>Wolverhampton Wanderers</td> <td>31</td> <td>15</td> <td>4</td> <td>12</td> <td>33</td> <td>27</td> <td>6</td> <td>49</td> </tr> <tr> <td>8</td> <td>West Ham United</td> <td>30</td> <td>14</td> <td>6</td> <td>10</td> <td>49</td> <td>39</td> <td>10</td> <td>48</td> </tr> <tr> <td>9</td> <td>Leicester City</td> <td>28</td> <td>10</td> <td>7</td> <td>11</td> <td>43</td> <td>47</td> <td>-4</td> <td>37</td> </tr> <tr> <td>10</td> <td>Aston Villa</td> <td>30</td> <td>11</td> <td>3</td> <td>16</td> <td>42</td> <td>42</td> <td>0</td> <td>36</td> </tr> <tr> <td>11</td> <td>Southampton FC</td> <td>30</td> <td>8</td> <td>12</td> <td>10</td> <td>37</td> <td>46</td> <td>-9</td> <td>36</td> </tr> <tr> <td>12</td> <td>Crystal Palace</td> <td>29</td> <td>7</td> <td>13</td> <td>9</td> <td>39</td> <td>38</td> <td>1</td> <td>34</td> </tr> <tr> <td>13</td> <td>Brighton & Hove Albion</td> <td>30</td> <td>7</td> <td>13</td> <td>10</td> <td>26</td> <td>36</td> <td>-10</td> <td>34</td> </tr> <tr> <td>14</td> <td>Brentford FC</td> <td>31</td> <td>9</td> <td>6</td> <td>16</td> <td>37</td> <td>48</td> <td>-11</td> <td>33</td> </tr> <tr> <td>15</td> <td>Newcastle United</td> <td>29</td> <td>7</td> <td>10</td> <td>12</td> <td>32</td> <td>49</td> <td>-17</td> <td>31</td> </tr> <tr> <td>16</td> <td>Leeds United</td> <td>31</td> <td>7</td> <td>9</td> <td>15</td> <td>35</td> <td>68</td> <td>-33</td> <td>30</td> </tr> <tr> <td>17</td> <td>Everton FC</td> <td>27</td> <td>7</td> <td>4</td> <td>16</td> <td>29</td> <td>47</td> <td>-18</td> <td>25</td> </tr> <tr> <td>18</td> <td>Watford FC</td> <td>30</td> <td>6</td> <td>4</td> <td>20</td> <td>29</td> <td>57</td> <td>-28</td> <td>22</td> </tr> <tr> <td>19</td> <td>Burnley FC</td> <td>28</td> <td>3</td> <td>12</td> <td>13</td> <td>22</td> <td>40</td> <td>-18</td> <td>21</td> </tr> <tr> <td>20</td> <td>Norwich City</td> <td>30</td> <td>4</td> <td>6</td> <td>20</td> <td>18</td> <td>63</td> <td>-45</td> <td>18</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <strong>Last updated: 1 min ago</strong> </p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p>Manchester United legend Gary Neville has provided a damning assessment of his former side after their clash with Leicester City.</p><p>The Red Devils took on the Foxes in Saturday&rsquo;s late Premier League kick-off, and put on another subpar display.</p><p>Leicester would take the lead in the game after 63 minutes, before Fred brought United back on level terms three minutes later.</p><p>The game went on to finish 1-1 and, in the opinion of Neville, his one-time employer&rsquo;s hopes of securing a Champions League berth, as a result, have come to an end:</p><p>&ldquo;I think so,&rdquo; Neville <a href="https://www.goal.com/en-gb/news/man-utd-out-top-four-race-flat-leicester-draw-neville/blt6cbe9fa288b78a2a" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a> when asked if United&rsquo;s top-four prospects were over. &ldquo;The run-in started today following the international break. They had to start it with a win but they didn&rsquo;t get it. It was the way they drew the game &ndash; that was really bad out there today.</p><p>&ldquo;Sometimes, teams can look a bit rusty when they come back but I thought the break would work for United as I thought it would be good for players to get away from the club and then come back and give it a right go.</p><p>&ldquo;This is going to be a long two months for those United players and fans. It&rsquo;s going to be difficult in their remaining eight matches if they continue in that vein of form.

<![CDATA[ <p>&nbsp;</p><p>An explanation for the absence of Ben Johnson from West Ham United&rsquo;s matchday squad to face Everton on Sunday has been provided.</p><p>With Vladimir Coufal still working his way back towards full fitness, it was widely predicted that youngster Johnson, on the back of a solid stretch of form prior to the international break, would be afforded his latest chance to impress this afternoon.</p><p>It therefore came as nothing short of a shock when, upon David Moyes&rsquo; matchday squad being unveiled, the 22-year-old was nowhere to be seen:</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"> <p dir="ltr" lang="en">&#128203; Our team for today is in!</p> <p>Bowen starts with Coufal also returning among the substitutes&hellip;</p> <p>COME ON YOU IRONS!!! &#9874;<a href="https://twitter.com/betway?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@betway</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WHUEVE?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#WHUEVE</a> <a href="https://t.co/OfaI2BoV6B" rel="nofollow">pic.twitter.com/OfaI2BoV6B</a></p> <p>&mdash; West Ham United (@WestHam) <a href="https://twitter.com/WestHam/status/1510587926727462914?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 3, 2022</a></p></blockquote><p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p><p>Speaking to the media on the back of the action coming to a close at the London Stadium, Moyes was therefore inevitably asked for an insight into Johnson&rsquo;s situation.</p><p>And West Ham&rsquo;s boss went on to reveal that his young full-back is struggling with an ongoing hamstring problem, albeit one which the club &lsquo;don&rsquo;t think is bad&rsquo;:</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"> <p dir="ltr" lang="en">Moyes on Johnson: &ldquo;He felt his hamstring playing for England.

That is never meant to be said with any amount of disrespect, of course, but the reality on paper is that both the Netherlands and Senegal are both a considerable distance ahead of Ecuador and host-nation Qatar. Though the Asian champions will be buoyed by the home support, anything other than a combination of a Dutch and Senegalese one-two in the table would go down as a huge surprise given the genuine amount of star power and attacking options both sides can call upon.</p><h2>Group B | England, IR Iran, United States, (Wales/Scotland/Ukraine)</h2><p> <table class="gg101__table"><thead><tr> <th>Group B</th> <th class="is-right">World Ranking</th> <th></th> </tr></thead><tbody><tr> <td><div class="flex aic"><img class="cj_flag" src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/themes/codeja-101goals/images/flags/england.png"> England</div></td> <td class="is-right">5</td> <td class="is-centered"></td></tr><tr> <td><div class="flex aic"><img class="cj_flag" src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/themes/codeja-101goals/images/flags/ir.png"> Iran</div></td> <td class="is-right">21</td> <td class="is-centered"></td></tr><tr> <td><div class="flex aic"><img class="cj_flag" src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/themes/codeja-101goals/images/flags/us.png"> United States</div></td> <td class="is-right">15</td> <td class="is-centered"></td></tr><tr> <td><div class="flex aic"><img class="cj_flag" src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/themes/codeja-101goals/images/flags/wales.png"> Wales or Scotland/Ukraine</div></td> <td class="is-right">18 or 39/27</td> <td class="is-centered"></td></tr></tbody></table> </p><p><strong>Average FIFA ranking</strong>: 21</p><p><strong>Combined World Cup wins</strong>: 1 (England; 1966)</p><p><strong>Stars of the Group</strong>: Harry Kane, Christian Pulisic, Sardar Azmoun, (TBD)</p><p><strong>Strength ranking</strong>: 6</p><p>This group was a little tricky to gauge partly given some of the rivalries that may come to the fore, and also because, well, if you pay attention to the news or politics&hellip;what? This was somehow not rigged? In any event, England are one of the real tournament heavyweights and really should see this out comfortably. The United States, for all their budding young talent, can be called into question on a tactical level and could find it difficult to tackle any of the potential nations from the European playoff, while Iran&rsquo;s attacking options offer a very credible monkey-wrench. Any side could finish second here, but the certainty around England puts this lower in the rankings.</p><h2>Group C | Argentina, Saudi Arabia, Mexico, Poland</h2><p> <table class="gg101__table"><thead><tr> <th>Group C</th> <th class="is-right">World Ranking</th> <th></th> </tr></thead><tbody><tr> <td><div class="flex aic"><img class="cj_flag" src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/themes/codeja-101goals/images/flags/ar.png"> Argentina</div></td> <td class="is-right">4</td> <td class="is-centered"></td></tr><tr> <td><div class="flex aic"><img class="cj_flag" src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/themes/codeja-101goals/images/flags/sa.png"> Saudi Arabia</div></td> <td class="is-right">49</td> <td class="is-centered"></td></tr><tr> <td><div class="flex aic"><img class="cj_flag" src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/themes/codeja-101goals/images/flags/mx.png"> Mexico</div></td> <td class="is-right">9</td> <td class="is-centered"></td></tr><tr> <td><div class="flex aic"><img class="cj_flag" src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/themes/codeja-101goals/images/flags/pl.png"> Poland</div></td> <td class="is-right">26</td> <td class="is-centered"></td></tr></tbody></table> </p><p><strong>Average FIFA ranking</strong>: 22</p><p><strong>Combined World Cup wins</strong>: 2 (Argentina; 1986, 1978)</p><p><strong>Stars of the Group</strong>: Lionel Messi, Robert Lewandowski, Ra&uacute;l Jim&eacute;nez, Salem Al-Dawsari</p><p><strong>Strength ranking</strong>: 4</p><p>Group C is deceptively tricky despite appearances. Argentina (ranked fourth in the world at the time of writing) are the clear favourites and their success at the latest Copa America proved that perhaps they are no longer overly reliant on Lionel Messi. But a swathe of questions exist on the state of their backline under Lionel Scaloni, which offers the likes of Poland and Mexico space to have influence. Mexico have already been giant killer four years ago when they helped eliminate Germany in the group stage, while Poland boast arguably the best centre-forward in the world in Robert Lewandowski. There is a real chance Argentina could flop, which is why this is placed where it is.</p><h2>Group D |&nbsp; France, (Australia/UAE/Peru), Denmark, Tunisia</h2><p> <table class="gg101__table"><thead><tr> <th>Group D</th> <th class="is-right">World Ranking</th> <th></th> </tr></thead><tbody><tr> <td><div class="flex aic"><img class="cj_flag" src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/themes/codeja-101goals/images/flags/fr.png"> France</div></td> <td class="is-right">3</td> <td class="is-centered"></td></tr><tr> <td><div class="flex aic"><img class="cj_flag" src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/themes/codeja-101goals/images/flags/pe.png"> Peru or Australia/UAE</div></td> <td class="is-right">22 or 42/68</td> <td class="is-centered"></td></tr><tr> <td><div class="flex aic"><img class="cj_flag" src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/themes/codeja-101goals/images/flags/dk.png"> Denmark</div></td> <td class="is-right">11</td> <td class="is-centered"></td></tr><tr> <td><div class="flex aic"><img class="cj_flag" src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/themes/codeja-101goals/images/flags/tn.png"> Tunisia</div></td> <td class="is-right">35</td> <td class="is-centered"></td></tr></tbody></table> </p><p><strong>Average FIFA ranking</strong>: 30</p><p><strong>Combined World Cup wins</strong>: 2 (France; 2018, 1998)</p><p><strong>Stars of the Group</strong>: Kylian Mbapp&eacute;, Christian Eriksen, Wahbi Khazri, (TBD)</p><p><strong>Strength ranking</strong>: 7</p><p>Surveying this group found a pretty similar overall assessment to that of Group A. France, as the current World Cup holders, really should be navigating Group D to the tune of three wins in three, or, at the very least, seven points come the end of group play if Denmark turn up in a manner similar to their Euro 2020 performances. But with that said, anything other than those two finishing one-two would be as shocking as proceedings in Group A given the potential fourth nation to be added. Tunisia are one of the better African sides there is no doubt, but by comparison, come up well short of the pair of European representatives. This <strong>should</strong> be straightforward&hellip;..</p><h2>Group E | Spain, (Costa Rica/New Zealand), Germany, Japan</h2><p> <table class="gg101__table"><thead><tr> <th>Group E</th> <th class="is-right">World Ranking</th> <th></th> </tr></thead><tbody><tr> <td><div class="flex aic"><img class="cj_flag" src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/themes/codeja-101goals/images/flags/es.png"> Spain</div></td> <td class="is-right">7</td> <td class="is-centered"></td></tr><tr> <td><div class="flex aic"><img class="cj_flag" src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/themes/codeja-101goals/images/flags/cr.png"> Costa Rica or New Zealand</div></td> <td class="is-right">31 or 101</td> <td class="is-centered"></td></tr><tr> <td><div class="flex aic"><img class="cj_flag" src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/themes/codeja-101goals/images/flags/de.png"> Germany</div></td> <td class="is-right">12</td> <td class="is-centered"></td></tr><tr> <td><div class="flex aic"><img class="cj_flag" src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/themes/codeja-101goals/images/flags/jp.png"> Japan</div></td> <td class="is-right">22</td> <td class="is-centered"></td></tr></tbody></table> </p><p><strong>Average FIFA ranking</strong>: 35</p><p><strong>Combined World Cup wins</strong>: 5 (Germany; 2014, 1990, 1974, 1954 | Spain; 2010)</p><p><strong>Stars of the Group</strong>: Ferran Torres, Joshua Kimmich, Takumi Minamino, (TBD)</p><p><strong>Strength ranking</strong>: 5</p><p>Any group with Spain and a rampantly resurgent Germany headlining it certainly deserved a bit of attention, and that is exacerbated when a side like Japan is added into the mix after their 2018 performance that saw them emerge from a group that also included Poland and Senegal. But Group E loses a bit of staying power in the conversation on the back of its potential fourth contestant, though Costa Rica have been in good form of late in their region. One would have to expect that Spain and Germany will find six points from six against their other opponents but Japan will unquestionably prove a tricky customer capable of stealing a decent result or two. It&rsquo;s not one of the strongest groups, but you can keep an eye on this one.</p><h2>Group F | Belgium, Canada, Morocco, Croatia</h2><p> <table class="gg101__table"><thead><tr> <th>Group F</th> <th class="is-right">World Ranking</th> <th></th> </tr></thead><tbody><tr> <td><div class="flex aic"><img class="cj_flag" src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/themes/codeja-101goals/images/flags/be.png"> Belgium</div></td> <td class="is-right">2</td> <td class="is-centered"></td></tr><tr> <td><div class="flex aic"><img class="cj_flag" src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/themes/codeja-101goals/images/flags/ca.png"> Canada</div></td> <td class="is-right">38</td> <td class="is-centered"></td></tr><tr> <td><div class="flex aic"><img class="cj_flag" src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/themes/codeja-101goals/images/flags/ma.png"> Morocco</div></td> <td class="is-right">24</td> <td class="is-centered"></td></tr><tr> <td><div class="flex aic"><img class="cj_flag" src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/themes/codeja-101goals/images/flags/hr.png"> Croatia</div></td> <td class="is-right">16</td> <td class="is-centered"></td></tr></tbody></table> </p><p><strong>Average FIFA ranking</strong>: 20</p><p><strong>Combined World Cup wins</strong>: 0</p><p><strong>Stars of the Group</strong>: Kevin De Bruyne, Luka Modri&#263;, Alphonso Davies, Achraf Hakimi</p><p><strong>Strength ranking</strong>: 2</p><p>There is a sense that with a group that contains Belgium and Croatia, the other nations just won&rsquo;t matter; this is not the case in Group F. Canada have taken CONCACAF by storm and offers up a very good forward line that will threaten during the entire group stage, while Morocco will be motivated by feeling hard done by at a series of events back in 2018. With the core of Croatia&rsquo;s brilliant national pool all aging, and Belgium yet to make good on their &ldquo;golden generation&rdquo;, a big upset could unfold here. The average FIFA ranking of all four nations is a testament to its strength.</p><h2>Group G | Brazil, Serbia, Switzerland, Cameroon</h2><p> <table class="gg101__table"><thead><tr> <th>Group G</th> <th class="is-right">World Ranking</th> <th></th> </tr></thead><tbody><tr> <td><div class="flex aic"><img class="cj_flag" src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/themes/codeja-101goals/images/flags/br.png"> Brazil</div></td> <td class="is-right">1</td> <td class="is-centered"></td></tr><tr> <td><div class="flex aic"><img class="cj_flag" src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/themes/codeja-101goals/images/flags/si.png"> Serbia</div></td> <td class="is-right">25</td> <td class="is-centered"></td></tr><tr> <td><div class="flex aic"><img class="cj_flag" src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/themes/codeja-101goals/images/flags/ch.png"> Switzerland</div></td> <td class="is-right">14</td> <td class="is-centered"></td></tr><tr> <td><div class="flex aic"><img class="cj_flag" src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/themes/codeja-101goals/images/flags/cm.png"> Cameroon</div></td> <td class="is-right">37</td> <td class="is-centered"></td></tr></tbody></table> </p><p><strong>Average FIFA ranking</strong>: 19</p><p><strong>Combined World Cup wins</strong>: 5 (Brazil; 2002, 1994, 1970, 1962, 1958)</p><p><strong>Stars of the Group</strong>: Neymar, Du&scaron;an Tadi&#263;, Xherdan Shaqiri, Vincent Aboubakar</p><p><strong>Strength ranking: 1 &ndash; The Group of Death</strong></p><p>The initial reaction to this group being confirmed in Doha was &lsquo;wow&rsquo;, and that opinion has not changed since the realization that three of these nations were in the same group at Russia 2018. Brazil are one of the tournament favourites and have the weight of expectations on them but have hardly been gifted an easy run to the knockout stage in Group G. Switzerland have a real habit of being one of those sides that collectively find results, and that was proved at Euro 2020. Serbia are brimming with talent (especially in attack and midfield) in an underrated side from back to front, while Cameroon are certainly a capable outfit that can catch anyone unawares if they do not come to ball. Anything can happen here, and it&rsquo;s what the World Cup is all about.</p><h2>Group H | Portugal, Ghana, Uruguay, Korea Republic</h2><p> <table class="gg101__table"><thead><tr> <th>Group H</th> <th class="is-right">World Ranking</th> <th></th> </tr></thead><tbody><tr> <td><div class="flex aic"><img class="cj_flag" src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/themes/codeja-101goals/images/flags/pt.png"> Portugal</div></td> <td class="is-right">8</td> <td class="is-centered"></td></tr><tr> <td><div class="flex aic"><img class="cj_flag" src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/themes/codeja-101goals/images/flags/gh.png"> Ghana</div></td> <td class="is-right">60</td> <td class="is-centered"></td></tr><tr> <td><div class="flex aic"><img class="cj_flag" src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/themes/codeja-101goals/images/flags/uy.png"> Uruguay</div></td> <td class="is-right">13</td> <td class="is-centered"></td></tr><tr> <td><div class="flex aic"><img class="cj_flag" src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/themes/codeja-101goals/images/flags/kr.png"> South Korea</div></td> <td class="is-right">29</td> <td class="is-centered"></td></tr></tbody></table> </p><p><strong>Average FIFA ranking</strong>: 28</p><p><strong>Combined World Cup wins</strong>: 2 (Uruguay; 1950, 1930)</p><p><strong>Stars of the Group</strong>: Cristiano Ronaldo, Lu&iacute;s Su&aacute;rez, Son Heung-min, Thomas Partey</p><p><strong>Strength ranking</strong>: 3</p><p>Much like Lionel Messi&rsquo;s Argentina, Cristiano Ronaldo headlines a Portugal outfit that is finally more a &lsquo;sum of its parts&rsquo; than the one-man show that they had been for years and they will bring a very good pool of players to Qatar. But the likes of Uruguay, Ghana, and Korea Republic are all sides that have proven themselves at the World Cup in recent years and could all prove frustrating opponents on any given day beyond the qualities they possess. Uruguay&rsquo;s vaunted attacking duo is always a potential ace in the hole, while Korea showed in 2018 they can topple the big boys when they beat Germany, and Ghana&rsquo;s record of being the only African side to ever reach the quarterfinals gives them a leg-up when it comes to tournament knowhow.</p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p>One Celtic star has come in for heavy criticism during the early stages of the Old Firm Derby.</p><p>Celtic and Rangers are, of course, currently locked in action at the Ibrox Stadium.</p><p>This matchup is always an entreating affair, but it has some added spice right now due to the nature of the SPL title race.</p><p>Celtic headed into the game sat top of the league with Rangers three points behind them.

<![CDATA[ <p>Former Manchester United defender and Sky Sports pundit Gary Neville has warned that the Ricketts family should move away from their bid to takeover Chelsea and that the Premier League should block the move following widespread protests against the impending new owners.</p><p>Following the forced sale of the club amid sanctions placed on Roman Abramovich amid links to Vladimir Putin and his war in Ukraine, there has been a race to decide the new owners of the west London club.</p><p>And it seems as though it is a race that the bid spearheaded by the Ricketts family is winning, despite Chelsea fans&nbsp;<em>en-masse&nbsp;</em>taking to social media to voice their opposition to the bid after islamaphobic comments came to light.</p><p>There was a protest ahead of their side&rsquo;s clash with Brentford too, albeit poorly attended, as the Chelsea faithful urged the government not to accept the bid.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"> <p dir="ltr" lang="en">&ldquo;F*** off the Ricketts, you&rsquo;re not wanted here.&rdquo; <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/cfc?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#cfc</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NoToRicketts?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#NoToRicketts</a> <a href="https://t.co/wyd0b04Huo" rel="nofollow">pic.twitter.com/wyd0b04Huo</a></p> <p>&mdash; Nizaar Kinsella (@NizaarKinsella) <a href="https://twitter.com/NizaarKinsella/status/1510219837838180354?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 2, 2022</a></p></blockquote><p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p><h2>Neville warns against unpopular owners</h2><p>Now, Gary Neville has had his say. Speaking about the situation on his podcast, he warned that the family should move away from the bid, citing the importance of fans and the duty of the government to ensure that they are listened to.</p><p>&lsquo;If I were the Ricketts family, and you&rsquo;re getting that type of hostility on the way in, move away&rsquo;, he said referencing the protests.</p><p>&lsquo;The fans are important&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;We&rsquo;ve seen what the Glazer family have done with Manchester United fans, we&rsquo;ve seen other examples of unpopular owners like Mike Ashley at Newcastle, and it drains the absolute life not just out of the football club, but out of the city and out of everybody watching because the energy goes&rsquo;, he continued.</p><p>&lsquo;We&rsquo;ve got to make sure moving forwards that it&rsquo;s not just about best bids, it&rsquo;s about what the fans want. I have to say, the Ricketts family are trying to reach out to Chelsea fans but they do have some historic issues that need dealing with and need explaining and at this moment in time they are not being explained very well.&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;In this current light, with what&rsquo;s happened with the Super League, what&rsquo;s happened with big picture, with Derby and Bury, with Roman Abramovich and the Ukraine War, we have to start bringing back some sort of moral compass when determining who owns a football club.&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;I find it very difficult to accept that, if the Chelsea fans en masse are against the takeover of the family, that are at this moment in time favourites, it should not happen. They have to be listened to.&rsquo;</p><p><iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wvs0oNkiOLQ" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p><p>While many will agree with the sentiment, whether they will be is another matter entirely.</p><h3>Read more:</h3><h3><a href="https://www.101greatgoals.com/news/major-development-confirmed-in-ricketts-familys-chelsea-bid/" rel="v:url">Major development confirmed in Ricketts Family&rsquo;s Chelsea bid</a></h3><h3><a href="https://www.101greatgoals.com/la-liga-betting-tips/real-sociedad-vs-espanyol-betting-tips-la-liga-preview/" rel="v:url">Real Sociedad vs Espanyol betting tips: La Liga preview, predictions and odds</a></h3> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p>Aston Villa are reportedly ready to rekindle their interest in a potential club-record move for Leeds United midfielder Kalvin Phillips, as contract negotiations at Elland Road have stalled.</p><p>Phillips is under contract with Leeds until 2024, meaning that come the summer the Yorkshire side will have to cash in on their asset or extend his deal in order to avoid losing him on the cheap in the year to come.</p><p>And, it was thought that he was close to signing a new deal with the club, with the player himself thought to be keen on staying at Elland Road beyond his current contract. However, that has been thrown up into the air, and the reliable John Percy of the Telegraph reports that talks have stalled over a new deal, perhaps hinging on whether Leeds remain a top flight club come the end of the season.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"> <p dir="ltr" lang="en">Aston Villa will push for &pound;60million Kalvin Phillips signing this summer &ndash; but move is complicated | <a href="https://twitter.com/JPercyTelegraph?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@JPercyTelegraph</a> reports <a href="https://t.co/uwfrh6pb8q" rel="nofollow">https://t.co/uwfrh6pb8q</a></p> <p>&mdash; Telegraph Football (@TeleFootball) <a href="https://twitter.com/TeleFootball/status/1510511959430553607?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 3, 2022</a></p></blockquote><p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p><p>And Villa are willing to shell out a club record &pound;60 million to get their man, it has been revealed. The report claims that &lsquo;Gerrard wants a player who will &lsquo;screen&rsquo; in front of his back-four and move Villa up the pitch, and Phillips possesses all the qualities required.&rsquo;</p><p>However, it will not be simple. In fact &lsquo;Villa&rsquo;s move for Phillips will be complicated, with Leeds determined to keep the talismanic midfielder and their resolve likely to be emboldened by avoiding relegation to the Championship&rsquo;.</p><p>Phillips returned to the Leeds side as a second-half substitute, after months on the sideline through injury, to a massive ovation at Elland Road as Southampton held Leeds to a 1-1 draw. His return will be a major boost to Jesse Marsch and his hopes of keeping Leeds in the top flight come the end of the season.</p><h2>Bissouma the alternative</h2><p>Another name mentioned by Percy is that of Yves Bissouma, who was seemingly set for a move to a bigger club than Aston Villa last summer, with Arsenal and Liverpool both sniffing around the Brighton man.</p><p>Such links have since gone cold, however, and while Villa had a &pound;25 million bid turned down in January, the Mali midfielder will have just 12 months left on his Seagulls contract come the Summer, and is in all likelihood to depart for a cut-price fee.</p><p> <div id="attachment_1641192" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1641192" class="size-large wp-image-1641192" src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/GettyImages-1362366545-1024x666.jpg" alt="Aston Villa ready to rekindle &pound;60 million deal as contract negotiations stall" width="1024" height="666" srcset="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/GettyImages-1362366545-1024x666.jpg 1024w, https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/GettyImages-1362366545-300x195.jpg 300w, https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/GettyImages-1362366545-768x500.jpg 768w, https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/GettyImages-1362366545-1536x999.jpg 1536w, https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/GettyImages-1362366545-2048x1333.jpg 2048w, https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/GettyImages-1362366545-910x592.jpg 910w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><p id="caption-attachment-1641192" class="wp-caption-text">Yves Bissouma is likely to leave Brighton on the cheap this summer as he enters the final year of his contract (Photo by Clive Brunskill/Getty Images)</p></div> </p><p>Whether or not his fortunes will take him to Villa Park or elsewhere remains to be seen.</p><h3>Read more:</h3><h3><a href="https://www.101greatgoals.com/la-liga-betting-tips/real-sociedad-vs-espanyol-betting-tips-la-liga-preview/" rel="v:url">Real Sociedad vs Espanyol betting tips: La Liga preview, predictions and odds</a></h3><h3><a href="https://www.101greatgoals.com/la-liga-betting-tips/fc-barcelona-vs-sevilla-betting-tips-la-liga-preview/" rel="v:url">Barcelona vs Sevilla betting tips: La Liga preview, predictions and odds</a></h3> ]]>
